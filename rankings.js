		If not:
			Recalc difficulties for all affected patterns. (calcPatternDifficulties with subset)

			Recalc THIS pattern's difficulty (everything you need is stored) (calcPatternDifficulties for just this pattern)
			Recalc user score of every user competing in this pattern, and update global rank (affectedUsersByPattern, and calcUserScores for subset, and updateGlobalRanks)
